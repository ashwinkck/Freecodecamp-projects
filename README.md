## 📁 Projects Overview

### 1. 🏥 Predict Health Costs with Regression
**Challenge**: Predict individual healthcare expenses using demographic data.  
**Tech**: Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras (Regression)  
**Highlights**:
- Preprocessed categorical features using one-hot encoding.
- Split dataset (80% training / 20% testing).
- Built a regression model with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under **$3500**, passing the challenge.

### 2. ✉️ SMS Text Classifier with Neural Networks
**Challenge**: Classify text messages as "spam" or "ham" using a neural network.  
**Tech**: TensorFlow, Keras, TextVectorization  
**Highlights**:
- Tokenized and vectorized SMS messages.
- Trained a binary classifier using a dense neural network.
- Built a `predict_message()` function for real-time predictions.
- Passed the test suite with 100% accuracy on benchmark examples.
